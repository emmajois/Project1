# Project1 - Emma Swalberg

What I did well:
- I learned SO much. I feel like this project stretched me to really apply what I have learned so far and made me create something with it.
- I made the game look very similar to the original card game.
- I met all the requirements of the project.
- I found a SwiftUI bug (with Dr. Liddle's help) when it came to the animation conflict in the lazyVGrid.
- I was very dedicated to completing the project well, and I sought out lots of help to best understand the project.

What I didn't go so well:
- I really shouldn't ahve tried to put my shapes horizontal. I would have saved myself a lot of time if I would have kept them vertical like Dr. Liddle did in the video.
- I wasn't very creative with colors or different animations.
- It took me so long to feel comfortable with the code that I didn't really go above and beyond any of the requirements.
- It took me a long time in general to complete this project, about 35 hours is what I estimate I put into this.

Grade I deserve:
I believe I deserve 100% on this assignment. Not only did I meet all the requirements, but I made sure I understood everything I was coding and I really turned this into a learning opportunity for myself. I didn't want to just complete the requirements and move on, I really wanted to learn and I was able to do that with this project.
